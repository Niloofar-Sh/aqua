## Auto-correction n-grams model
In a spelling correction task, an n-gram is a sequence of n letters in a word or a string. The n-gram model can be used to compute the similarity between two strings, by counting the number of similar n-grams they share. The more similar ngrams between two strings exist the more similar they are [Ahmed et al.](http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/poli/n40/n40a7.pdf).
