Metadata is the “Data about data”, i.e., additional information provided about datasets. The SPARC dataset metadata includes information such as title, description, techniques, as well as the number of the files, formats, licenses, etc. ([SPARC dataset metadata](https://staging.sparc.science/help/3vcLloyvrvmnK3Nopddrka#metadata)).
