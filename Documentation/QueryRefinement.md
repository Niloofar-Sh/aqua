## Auto-correction n-grams model
In spelling correction task, an n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n letters from a given sample of text. An n-gram model is utilised to compare strings and compute the similarity between two words, by counting the number of similar n-grams they share. This technique is language independent. The more similar n-grams between two words exist the more similar they are ([Ahmed et al.](http://www.scielo.org.mx/pdf/poli/n40/n40a7.pdf)).
