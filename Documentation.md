# Analysis of the existing SPARC search portal

1. Limited search feature of the SPARC Portal:
   It does not recognize nearby words (in case of **typos**). As an example, if we type "rattis" (typo) instead of "rattus", it does not recognize it or give any suggestion (Fig 1).

   <br/>
2. You need to enter the exact correct keywords in the search bar (Fig 2) and yet, it does not **highlight the keywords** of your query among the search results.

   <br/>
   
3. Limited **filterings** on the results display page, i.e., sorting based on the date of publication, author, and alphabetical order. The website currently refines the results by either being "Public" or "Embargoed" (Fig 3).

   <br/>
   
4. In case of no results being found for the queries, there is no way for the user to get informed on whether a **new dataset/resource** (related to their query) has been published on the SPARC portal or not.

# Objectives for the new SPARC search portal
Specific features have beed added to the new SPARC search portal as listed below:
<br/>
* __Query refinement__:
   * Auto-completion:<br/>
      Based on the term, our tool automatically completes the queries if it partially/completely matches any keywords.
   * Suggestion:<br/>
      If no matches are found, it finds close-matches and suggests them to the user with popping up the phrase: *"Did you mean ...?"*

* __Results filtering__:
   * Improved filtering:<br/>
      blah blah blah
* __Additional feature__:
   * ''Notify me":<br/>
      blah blah blah
<br/>
